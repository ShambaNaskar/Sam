                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Welcome to the fascinating world of Electrostatics! This branch of physics deals with the
                            study of electric charges at rest and their interactions. It explores phenomena such as
                            electric fields, electric potential, and the behavior of charged particles. In
                            Electrostatics, we delve into the fundamental principles that govern static electricity and
                            its applications in various fields, from electronics to electromagnetism.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Electric Charge: </b>
                        <p>Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that determines its interaction with
                            electric fields. It exists in two forms: positive and negative. Like charges repel each
                            other, while opposite charges attract each other. </p>
                        <p>The unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). One coulomb of charge is equivalent to the
                            charge of approximately 6.24 × 10<sup>18</sup> electrons (for negative charge) or protons
                            (for positive charge).</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Quantization of charge: </b>
                        <p>Quantization of charge is a fundamental concept in physics that states that electric charge
                            comes in discrete, indivisible units. The smallest unit of charge is the elementary charge
                            e, which is the charge of a single proton or electron.</p>
                        <p>The magnitude of the elementary charge is approximately 1.602 × 10<sup>-19</sup> coulombs.
                            This means that any electric charge in a system must be a multiple of this elementary
                            charge. In other words, charge cannot exist in fractions of the elementary charge; it is
                            quantized.</p>

                        <b>Electrostatic Induction: </b>
                        <p>Electrostatic induction is when a charged object affects the distribution of charges in a nearby uncharged object without touching it. It happens because of the electric field created by the charged object, causing charges in the uncharged object to redistribute temporarily. This process results in a separation of charges in the uncharged object, known as electrostatic induction.</p>

It works by diverting the excessive electrical energy from lightning strikes away from sensitive equipment and safely dissipating it into the ground.</p>
                        <p>Lightning arresters are commonly used in electrical systems, such as power distribution networks, telecommunications systems, and buildings, to protect against lightning-induced surges. They play a crucial role in safeguarding equipment, preventing downtime, and ensuring safety in electrical installations.</p>

                        <p>An electric field is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the influence of electric forces on charged objects within a given region of space. It is represented by a vector quantity that points in the direction of the force experienced by a positive test charge placed in the field.</p>
                        <p>In simple terms, an electric field is a region around a charged object where other charged objects experience a force. The strength of the electric field is determined by the magnitude of the charges creating the field and the distance from these charges.</p>

                        <br><p><i>Inverse Square Law: </i> The force between charges decreases with the square of the distance between them. This means that the force is stronger when charges are closer together and weaker when they are farther apart. </p>
                        <br><p><i>Proportional to Charge Magnitude: </i>The force is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges. Greater charges experience stronger forces.

                        <br><p><i>Direction of the Force: </i>Coulomb's Law provides information about the magnitude of the force but not its direction. The direction of the force depends on the signs of the charges: like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract.</p>

                        <b>What is An electron volt?</b>
                        <p>An electron volt (eV) is a unit of energy commonly used in physics, particularly in the study of atomic and subatomic particles. It is defined as the amount of kinetic energy gained or lost by an electron when accelerated or decelerated through an electric potential difference of one volt.</p>
                        <br><p>One electron volt is equal to the kinetic energy gained (or lost) by an electron when it is accelerated (or decelerated) through an electric potential difference of one volt. Mathematically, 1eV = 1.602 × 10<sup>-19</sup> J.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Capacitance is a fundamental property in physics and electrical engineering that describes the ability of a capacitor to store electric charge or energy in an electric field. It is denoted by the symbol C and is measured in farads (F).</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Capacitance: </b>
                        <p>Capacitance is defined as the ratio of the electric charge Q stored on a conductor to the electric potential difference V across the conductor. Mathematically, C = Q / V.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Capacitors: </b>
                        <p>Capacitance is a property of capacitors, which are devices designed to store electric charge and energy in an electric field between two conductors separated by an insulating material (dielectric).</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Energy Storage: </b>
                        <p>Capacitance determines the amount of electric charge that can be stored on a capacitor for a given potential difference. The energy stored in a capacitor is given by U = ½CV<sup>2</sup>. 
                        <p>Where U is the energy, C is the capacitance, and V is the potential difference.</p></p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Applications: </b>
                        <p>Capacitance plays a crucial role in electronic circuits, power systems, and electrical devices. Capacitors are used for energy storage, filtering, timing, voltage regulation, and many other applications in electronics and electrical engineering.</p>
