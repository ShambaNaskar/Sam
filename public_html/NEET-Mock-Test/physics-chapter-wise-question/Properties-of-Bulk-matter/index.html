                    <li>
                        <b>What is Elasticity?</b>
                        <p>Elasticity refers to the property of a material that allows it to return to its original
                            shape and size after being deformed by an external force. This ability to deform reversibly
                            under stress and then return to its original form when the stress is removed is
                            characteristic of elastic materials.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Perfectly Rigid Body:</b>
                        <p>A perfectly rigid body is an idealized concept in mechanics where the body does not deform
                            under the action of external forces. It maintains its shape and size regardless of the
                            applied forces.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Perfectly Elastic Body:</b>
                        <p>A perfectly elastic body is an ideal material that deforms reversibly under stress and
                            regains its original shape completely when the stress is removed, without any energy loss.
                            This ideal behavior is rarely observed in real-world materials.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Elasticity Limit: </b>
                        <p>The elasticity limit, also known as the elastic limit or yield point, is the maximum stress
                            or force that a material can withstand without permanent deformation. Beyond this limit, the
                            material undergoes plastic deformation.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Perfectly Inelastic Body: </b>
                        <p>A perfectly inelastic body is an idealized material that does not regain its original shape
                            after deformation, even when the deforming force is removed. This is often seen in materials
                            that experience permanent deformation or plastic behavior.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Partly Elastic Body: </b>
                        <p>A partly elastic body is a material that exhibits both elastic and plastic behavior under
                            stress. It can deform elastically up to a certain point (elastic limit) before undergoing
                            permanent deformation.</p>
                    </li>

                            walls of the container. This principle is based on the fact that fluids are virtually
                            incompressible, so any change in pressure at one point in a confined fluid will propagate
                            throughout the entire fluid volume.</p>

                            and use of liquids, particularly water or other fluids, in motion or at rest. It focuses on

                        <p>Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid (such as water or air) on an object placed in

                            apparent loss of weight when submerged in the fluid. Buoyancy is a crucial concept in fluid
                            mechanics and plays a significant role in various real-world applications.</p>

                        <p>The buoyant force is directly proportional to the volume of fluid displaced by the object. It
                            is governed by Archimedes' principle.</p>
                        <br>
                        <b> Archimedes' Principle</b>
                        <p>Archimedes' Principle is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics, named after the ancient
                            Greek mathematician and scientist Archimedes. It states that when a body is partially or
                            fully submerged in a fluid (liquid or gas), it experiences an upward buoyant force equal to
                            the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.</p> <br>
                        <p>F<sub>buoyant</sub> = ρ<sub>fluid</sub> × V<sub>displaced</sub> × g</p> <br>

                        <p>Where: F<sub>buoyant</sub> is the density of the fluid, V<sub>displaced</sub> is the volume
                            of fluid displaced by the object.</p> <br>

                        <p>The buoyant force allows objects with lower density than the fluid to float, while objects
                            with higher density sink. It is why ships and boats float on water, balloons rise in air,
                            and submarines can control their depth by adjusting their buoyancy.</p>

                        <b>Why floating body has no apparent weight?</b>
                        <p>A floating body appears to have no weight when it is in equilibrium with the fluid it is
                            floating in. This phenomenon occurs due to the balance of forces acting on the body,
                            particularly the buoyant force and the gravitational force.</p><br>
                        <p>When an object is partially or fully submerged in a fluid, it displaces an amount of fluid
                            equal to its own weight. According to Archimedes' Principle, the buoyant force acting on the
                            object is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. This buoyant force acts in the
                            opposite direction to gravity.</p><br>
                        <p>If the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the object, the object will float without
                            sinking or rising. In this state of equilibrium, the apparent weight of the floating body is
                            effectively zero because the buoyant force counteracts the gravitational force.</p><br>
                        <p>It's important to note that the apparent weightlessness of a floating body is a result of the
                            balance of forces and the specific conditions of buoyancy. If the object's density is
                            adjusted or the fluid's density changes, the equilibrium and apparent weightlessness may no
                            longer hold.</p>

                            like a bowl floating in water; if you push it down, it returns to its initial position.</p>

                            from its original position. There is no restoring force that brings it back to equilibrium.

                            each other in a regular and predictable manner without significant mixing or disruption.
                            This type of flow is typically observed at low fluid velocities, in narrow channels or
                            pipes, or under conditions of steady and uniform flow. Laminar flow is characterized by low

                            pressure variations. This type of flow is typically observed at high fluid velocities, in

                            Turbulent flow is characterized by high fluid velocity, low viscosity, and the presence of
                            turbulence, which results in increased friction, energy loss, and mixing of fluid particles.

                        <b>What is Viscosity?</b>
                        <p>Viscosity refers to the resistance of a fluid to flow. It's a measure of how easily a fluid
                            can deform or move. Higher viscosity means the fluid is thicker and flows more slowly, like
                            honey or molasses. Lower viscosity indicates a thinner fluid that flows more easily, like
                            water or air.</p>

                        <p>The coefficient of viscosity, denoted by η, is a measure of the internal friction within a
                            fluid. It quantifies the resistance of a fluid to deformation or flow. High viscosity fluids
                            have a higher coefficient of viscosity, indicating stronger internal friction and slower
                            flow rates, while low viscosity fluids have a lower coefficient of viscosity, allowing for
                            easier deformation and faster flow.</p>

                            of viscosity is the Pascal-second (Pa·s) or the centipoise (cP). The dimensions of viscosity
                            are [ML<sup>-1</sup>T<sup>-1</sup>], which represent mass per unit length per unit time.</p>

                            diameter of the pipe, viscosity of the fluid, and density.

                            Reynolds Number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid mechanics to predict flow
                            patterns in different fluid flow situations. It's calculated using the formula:
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Re = (ρ⋅v⋅L) / μ</p><br>
                        <p>Where: ρ is the density of the fluid, v is the velocity of the fluid relative to the object,
                            L is a characteristic linear dimension (like the diameter of a pipe), and μ is the dynamic
